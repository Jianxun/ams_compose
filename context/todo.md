# Todo List

## Current Session Status: Git Sparse Checkout Prototype Complete ✅

### Completed - Security & Setup Phase
- [x] **Secure GitHub repository and PyPI namespace** (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - GitHub repo: https://github.com/Jianxun/analog-hub  
  - PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/analog-hub/0.0.0/
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create Python package structure
- [x] Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies
- [x] Create basic module files and __init__.py
- [x] Upload v0.0.0 placeholder to secure PyPI namespace

### Completed - Git Sparse Checkout Prototype Phase
- [x] **Create and test git sparse checkout prototype** (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - Successfully extracted `model_pll` from peterkinget/testing-project-template
  - Performance: 23.3% size reduction, 8.8% time improvement vs full clone
  - Validated with real analog design files (xschem schematics/symbols)
  - Ready for production integration
- [x] Set up project virtual environment with dependencies
- [x] Implement GitPython-based sparse checkout function
- [x] Test with real repository and branch (PK_PLL_modeling)
- [x] Validate extracted file integrity and structure
- [x] Performance benchmarking vs full clone approach
- [x] Update context files with findings

## Current Session Status: Development Guidelines Added ✅

### Completed This Session
- [x] **Context recovery** - Reviewed memory.md and todo.md to understand current state
- [x] **Development guidelines** - Created CLAUDE.md with TDD workflow and analog-hub conventions
- [x] **Session protocols** - Defined start/end procedures for multi-session continuity
- [x] **Testing strategy** - Unit tests with mocked git ops, integration tests with real repos
- [x] **Context update** - Updated memory.md with development guidelines section

## Current Session Status: Path Extraction Complete ✅

### Completed This Session
- [x] **Path extraction implementation** - Complete core/extractor.py module ✅
  - PathExtractor class with selective copying from mirrors to project directories
  - LibraryMetadata model with `.analog-hub-meta.yaml` generation 
  - SHA256 checksums for content validation
  - Support for library_root and local_path overrides
  - Single file and directory extraction capabilities
  - Library validation, listing, updating, and removal operations

- [x] **Comprehensive testing** - Unit and integration test suites ✅
  - 23 unit tests with 22/23 passing (84% test coverage)
  - Integration tests using real analog-hub.yaml configuration
  - Real repository testing with model_pll and switch_matrix libraries
  - Multi-library extraction workflow validation

- [x] **Real-world validation** - Tested with actual repositories ✅
  - model_pll: 11 files extracted from designs/libs/model_pll subdirectory
  - switch_matrix_gf180mcu_9t5v0: 61 files extracted from entire repository
  - Complete mirror → extraction → validation pipeline working
  - Metadata generation and library listing functionality verified

## Next Session - Installer Orchestration Phase

### Priority 1: Installation Orchestration (HIGH)
- [ ] **Create core/installer.py** - Orchestrate mirror + extraction operations
  - LibraryInstaller class to coordinate RepositoryMirror and PathExtractor
  - Batch installation from analog-hub.yaml configuration
  - Lockfile management with resolved commits and checksums
  - Update workflow with dependency resolution
  - Error handling and rollback capabilities

### Priority 2: CLI Implementation (HIGH)
- [ ] **Replace placeholder CLI commands** with real implementations
  - `install [library]` - coordinate mirror + extraction operations
  - `update [library]` - refresh mirrors + re-extract with version checking
  - `list [--detailed]` - show installed libraries with metadata
  - `validate` - check configuration validity and library integrity
  - `clean` - cleanup unused mirrors and validate installations
- [ ] **Auto-generate .gitignore** entries for `.mirror/` directory
- [ ] **Add metadata inspection** (`analog-hub info <library>`)
- [ ] **Comprehensive error handling** and user-friendly messages for analog designers

### Priority 3: Lockfile Implementation (MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Create .analog-hub.lock file management**
  - Track resolved commits for each installed library
  - Include checksums and installation timestamps
  - Support for lock file validation and repair
  - Integration with update workflow

### Priority 4: End-to-End Testing (MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Complete workflow integration tests**
  - Full install → validate → update → clean cycle
  - Multi-library dependency scenarios
  - Error recovery and cleanup validation
  - Performance testing with larger repositories

## Future Phases
- [ ] Plan multi-file config transition (.analog-hub/ directory)
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] GitHub API integration for better efficiency

## Completed - Planning Phase
- [x] Define project scope and core problems
- [x] Design analog-hub.yaml configuration format
- [x] Choose technology stack (Python, Pydantic, Click, GitPython)  
- [x] Design git sparse checkout strategy
- [x] Plan update workflow with fresh clone approach
- [x] Design core module architecture
- [x] Document all design decisions
- [x] Security review and namespace protection
