# Todo List

## Current Session Status: Git Sparse Checkout Prototype Complete ✅

### Completed - Security & Setup Phase
- [x] **Secure GitHub repository and PyPI namespace** (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - GitHub repo: https://github.com/Jianxun/analog-hub  
  - PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/analog-hub/0.0.0/
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create Python package structure
- [x] Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies
- [x] Create basic module files and __init__.py
- [x] Upload v0.0.0 placeholder to secure PyPI namespace

### Completed - Git Sparse Checkout Prototype Phase
- [x] **Create and test git sparse checkout prototype** (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - Successfully extracted `model_pll` from peterkinget/testing-project-template
  - Performance: 23.3% size reduction, 8.8% time improvement vs full clone
  - Validated with real analog design files (xschem schematics/symbols)
  - Ready for production integration
- [x] Set up project virtual environment with dependencies
- [x] Implement GitPython-based sparse checkout function
- [x] Test with real repository and branch (PK_PLL_modeling)
- [x] Validate extracted file integrity and structure
- [x] Performance benchmarking vs full clone approach
- [x] Update context files with findings

## Current Session Status: Development Guidelines Added ✅

### Completed This Session
- [x] **Context recovery** - Reviewed memory.md and todo.md to understand current state
- [x] **Development guidelines** - Created CLAUDE.md with TDD workflow and analog-hub conventions
- [x] **Session protocols** - Defined start/end procedures for multi-session continuity
- [x] **Testing strategy** - Unit tests with mocked git ops, integration tests with real repos
- [x] **Context update** - Updated memory.md with development guidelines section

## Next Session - Core Implementation Phase

### Priority 1: Mirror Operations (HIGH)
- [ ] **Create core/mirror.py** - Repository mirroring operations
  - Full clone to `.mirror/{repo_hash}/` directory
  - Branch/tag/commit switching within mirrors
  - Mirror cleanup and maintenance utilities
  - Error handling for git operations

### Priority 2: Path Extraction (HIGH)  
- [ ] **Create core/extractor.py** - Selective path copying
  - Copy specific source_path from mirror to local project
  - Handle library-root vs local_path override logic
  - Generate `.analog-hub-meta.yaml` in each installed library
  - Preserve file permissions and timestamps
  - Directory structure management and conflict handling

### Priority 3: Installation Logic (HIGH)
- [ ] **Create core/installer.py** - Orchestrate mirror + extraction
  - Coordinate mirror operations with path extraction
  - Update lockfile with resolved commits and checksums
  - Handle version pinning and library updates
  - Checksum validation for installed libraries

### Priority 4: CLI Implementation (MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Replace placeholder CLI commands** with real implementations
  - `install` - clone mirrors + extract paths
  - `update` - refresh mirrors + re-extract  
  - `list` - show installed libraries with metadata
  - `validate` - check configuration validity
  - `clean` - cleanup unused mirrors
- [ ] **Auto-generate .gitignore** entries for `.mirror/` directory
- [ ] **Add metadata inspection** (`analog-hub info <library>`)
- [ ] **Comprehensive error handling** and user-friendly messages

## Future Phases
- [ ] Plan multi-file config transition (.analog-hub/ directory)
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] GitHub API integration for better efficiency

## Completed - Planning Phase
- [x] Define project scope and core problems
- [x] Design analog-hub.yaml configuration format
- [x] Choose technology stack (Python, Pydantic, Click, GitPython)  
- [x] Design git sparse checkout strategy
- [x] Plan update workflow with fresh clone approach
- [x] Design core module architecture
- [x] Document all design decisions
- [x] Security review and namespace protection
