# Project Memory

## Current Status
- **Project**: analog-hub - Dependency management tool for analog IC design repositories
- **Stage**: MVP Complete, Test Suite Refactored
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-26

## Recent Major Changes (Last 2-3 Sessions Only)

### Extractor Test Coverage Improvement - 2025-07-27
- **Problem**: extractor.py had 73% test coverage with 22 missing lines, mostly error handling paths
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive tests for all uncovered code paths including exception handling, cleanup scenarios, and edge cases
- **Status**: Complete - Coverage improved from 73% to 99% (22 missing lines → 1 missing line)
- **Benefits**: Robust error handling validation, comprehensive edge case coverage, improved code reliability

### Test Strategy Optimization - 2025-07-27
- **Problem**: Integration tests used real GitHub repos causing network dependencies, slow execution, brittleness
- **Solution**: Removed integration tests entirely, rely on comprehensive E2E tests with mock repos
- **Status**: Complete - Integration tests removed, test coverage report generated (83% overall)
- **Benefits**: Faster, more reliable test suite; E2E tests provide superior workflow coverage

### Core Unit Test Breaking Changes Fixed - 2025-07-27
- **Problem**: 8 split core unit test modules had breaking changes from metadata refactor (field name changes, method signature changes)
- **Solution**: Updated all test modules to use new LockEntry field names, fixed installer.py validate_installation method to use lightweight architecture
- **Status**: Complete - All 35 core unit tests passing, no metadata file dependencies remaining
- **Benefits**: Clean lightweight architecture, all core tests stable, ready for development
- **Problem**: Monolithic test files (test_extractor.py, test_installer.py) with breaking changes from metadata refactor
- **Solution**: Split into focused modules by responsibility - path resolution, extraction, validation, config, batch ops
- **Status**: Complete - All files split and fixed
- **Benefits**: Easier debugging, focused testing, cleaner git diffs

### Metadata Architecture Consolidation - 2025-07-26
- **Problem**: Dual metadata system creates file clutter (.analog-hub-meta*.yaml files)
- **Solution**: Single lockfile architecture with lightweight return types (MirrorState, ExtractionState)
- **Status**: Complete
- **Benefits**: Clean workspace, single source of truth, simplified validation

### Test Suite Refactor - 2025-07-26
- **Problem**: Flat test structure after metadata refactor, unclear organization
- **Solution**: Implemented 3-tier hierarchy (unit/integration/e2e) with logical module organization
- **Status**: Complete - All tests moved to new structure
- **Benefits**: Clear separation by speed/scope, improved TDD workflow, organized by functionality

## Key Architecture Decisions (Stable Decisions Only)
- **Mirror-based approach**: Full clone to .mirror/ directory with SHA256 naming
- **Smart install logic**: Skip libraries that don't need updates
- **Single lockfile**: All state in .analog-hub.lock, no metadata files
- **2-tier test structure**: unit/ (fast, mocked), e2e/ (full workflows with mock repos)
- **Technology stack**: Python + Click + GitPython + Pydantic

## Active Issues & Next Steps
- **Current Priority**: Test coverage improvement and CLI development
- **Blockers**: None - test strategy optimized, core architecture stable
- **Next Session Goals**: Improve unit test coverage (mirror.py 77%, CLI 76%), add CLI unit tests
- **Test Strategy**: Unit tests (mocked) → E2E tests (mock repos) → Manual validation (real repos occasionally)
- **Coverage Status**: extractor.py 99% ✅, mirror.py 77%, CLI 76%

## Test Modules Status (All Core Tests Working - 35/35 passing)
- **test_extractor_path_resolution.py** - ✅ 3 tests - Path resolution logic
- **test_extractor_checksum.py** - ✅ 3 tests - Checksum calculation methods  
- **test_extractor_extraction.py** - ✅ 5 tests - File/directory extraction operations
- **test_extractor_validation.py** - ✅ 8 tests - Library validation and management
- **test_installer_config.py** - ✅ 6 tests - Configuration and lockfile operations
- **test_installer_single.py** - ✅ 2 tests - Single library installation
- **test_installer_batch.py** - ✅ 4 tests - Batch installation operations
- **test_installer_management.py** - ✅ 4 tests - Library management (validate_installation fixed)
